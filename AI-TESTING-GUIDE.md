## ðŸŽ¯ **Sample Topics to Test:**

### **Programming/Tech Topics:**
> "Today we're learning about JavaScript arrays. Arrays are ordered lists of data. The push method adds elements to the end of an array, while pop removes the last element. The length property tells us how many items are in the array. We can access elements using bracket notation with an index number."

### **Science Topics:**
> "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. Plants use chlorophyll to capture light energy, carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the soil. The chemical reaction produces glucose for energy and releases oxygen as a byproduct."

### **Business Topics:**
> "Marketing strategy involves understanding your target audience and creating value propositions that resonate with them. The four P's of marketing are Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. Digital marketing has transformed how businesses reach customers through social media, email campaigns, and search engine optimization."
